  description: `Rooted in the timeless principles of Sanatan Dharma and the needs of today, the ${foundationInfo.nameEnglish} Foundation is a humble yet powerful initiative, born in the sacred Dev Bhumi of Rishikesh, by socially conscious volunteers.

Drawing inspiration from the Rishis and their teachings, and from the morals of Sanatan Dharma, we are committed to the upliftment of underprivileged children through the light of education.

Our work is inspired by the age-old duty of service — Parmaarth (selfless service), Karuna (compassion), Dharma (duty) and Vidya Daan (donation of knowledge). We believe that true service to Dharma is incomplete without service to society.

Sanatan philosophy has dignified Vidya (knowledge) meant to awaken the inherent infinite potential within each child, emphasizing internal learning alongside external skills. By providing a nurturing environment inspired by the gurukul tradition, we strive to empower the next generation with knowledge, discipline, and cultural pride.`,

    description: `We are rooted in the sacred Gurukul parampara—India's timeless ashram-based system of education—where students learn under the loving guidance of Gurus. This holistic approach nurtures body, mind, and soul, imparting academic knowledge alongside self-discipline, humility, moral values, and practical life skills through lived experience.

Students live as part of a spiritual family, with essential needs like food, clothing and basic school supplies provided so they can fully focus on sadhana and learning.`,

  verseSource: 'Subhāṣita Ratna Bhāņdāgāra',
  description: `We envision a future where no child is left behind due to poverty – where every child has access to quality education that is modern in method yet deeply rooted in Indian ethos.

A future where knowledge is not only a means to livelihood, but a path to inner growth, social harmony, and national service.

Unlike other forms of charity that address immediate needs like food (Anna Daan), money (Dhana Daan) or land (Bhu Daan), knowledge multiplies when shared.`

As custodians of a knowledge-rich heritage, it is our dharma to act. Inspired by the transformative power of education and the sacred teachings of our scriptures and culture, we established this foundation to restore India's true potential — one child at a time.

With humility and conviction, we invite you to join us in this noble endeavor. Even a small offering, when done with a pure heart, becomes a blessing for many.`
