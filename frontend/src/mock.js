  description: `Rooted in the timeless principles of Sanatan Dharma and the needs of today, the ${foundationInfo.nameEnglish} Foundation is a humble yet powerful initiative, born in the sacred Dev Bhumi of Rishikesh, by socially conscious volunteers.

Drawing inspiration from the Rishis and their teachings, and from the morals of Sanatan Dharma, we are committed to the upliftment of underprivileged children through the light of education.

Our work is inspired by the age-old duty of service — Parmaarth (selfless service), Karuna (compassion), Dharma (duty) and Vidya Daan (donation of knowledge). We believe that true service to Dharma is incomplete without service to society.

Sanatan philosophy has dignified Vidya (knowledge) meant to awaken the inherent infinite potential within each child, emphasizing internal learning alongside external skills. By providing a nurturing environment inspired by the gurukul tradition, we strive to empower the next generation with knowledge, discipline, and cultural pride.`,

Unlike other forms of charity that address immediate needs like food (Anna Daan), money (Dhana Daan) or land (Bhu Daan), knowledge multiplies when shared.`
