  description: `Rooted in the timeless principles of Sanatan Dharma and the needs of today, the ${foundationInfo.nameEnglish} Foundation is a humble yet powerful initiative, born in the sacred Dev Bhumi of Rishikesh, by socially conscious volunteers.

Drawing inspiration from the Rishis and their teachings, and from the morals of Sanatan Dharma, we are committed to the upliftment of underprivileged children through the light of education.

Our work is inspired by the age-old duty of service — Parmaarth (selfless service), Karuna (compassion), Dharma (duty) and Vidya Daan (donation of knowledge). We believe that true service to Dharma is incomplete without service to society.

Sanatan philosophy has dignified Vidya (knowledge) meant to awaken the inherent infinite potential within each child, emphasizing internal learning alongside external skills. By providing a nurturing environment inspired by the gurukul tradition, we strive to empower the next generation with knowledge, discipline, and cultural pride.`

  description: `The ${foundationInfo.nameEnglish} Foundation is dedicated to providing free, holistic education to economically disadvantaged children, grounded in the perpetual values of Sanatan Dharma, and to nurture them into responsible, confident, capable and spiritually aware citizens of Bharat.

We provide future generations with tools for self-reliance and personal growth, with the ultimate goal of attaining both spiritual and material well-being.

This initiative is not charity — it is a sacred offering (yajna) for the upliftment of society.`

  sanskritVerse: 'न चौर हार्यं न च राज हार्य, न भ्रातृभाज्यं न च भारकारी। व्यये कृते वर्धत एव नित्यं, विद्याधनं सर्वधनप्रधानम्',
  verseTranslation: 'Knowledge is wealth that cannot be stolen by thieves, taken by kings, divided among brothers, or burdened by carrying. It only increases when given and is the supreme form of wealth.',
  verseSource: 'Subhāṣita Ratna Bhāņdāgāra',
  description: `We envision a future where no child is left behind due to poverty – where every child has access to quality education that is modern in method yet deeply rooted in Indian ethos.

A future where knowledge is not only a means to livelihood, but a path to inner growth, social harmony, and national service.

Unlike other forms of charity that address immediate needs like food (Anna Daan), money (Dhana Daan) or land (Bhu Daan), knowledge multiplies when shared.`

As custodians of a knowledge-rich heritage, it is our dharma to act. Inspired by the transformative power of education and the sacred teachings of our scriptures and culture, we established this foundation to restore India's true potential — one child at a time.

With humility and conviction, we invite you to join us in this noble endeavor. Even a small offering, when done with a pure heart, becomes a blessing for many.`
